Learn About Muscular and Non-Specific Low Back

How Your Input Relates
You indicated pain in your lower back, possibly worsened by sitting for too long, bending forward, or
without a clear pattern, or pain in the buttock or outer thigh not extending past the knee. These
symptoms are commonly associated with muscular or non-specific low back pain, so this guide focuses
on helping you understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Muscular or Non-Specific Low Back Pain?
Muscular or non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) refers to pain in the lower back without a clear
structural cause, often involving muscles, ligaments, or soft tissues [Chou et al., 2007]. It affects over
85% of people with back pain, making it the most common type [Chou et al., 2007]. Common features
include:
- Symptoms: Diffuse or localized pain in the lower back, sometimes spreading to the buttock or outer
thigh (not past the knee). Pain may worsen with prolonged sitting, bending forward, or repetitive
movements [Qaseem et al., 2017].
- Relief: Gentle movement, changing positions, or rest may reduce discomfort in some cases [Chou et

al., 2007].
- Other Signs: Typically no significant weakness or numbness; pain may feel sore or stiff but lacks
specific triggers like arching backward [van Tulder et al., 1997].
Causes may include muscle strain, poor posture, stress, or lack of physical activity. Most cases improve
within 4–6 weeks with conservative care [Pengel et al., 2003].

When to Seek Help
Most NSLBP improves within 4–6 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et al., 2007;
Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
