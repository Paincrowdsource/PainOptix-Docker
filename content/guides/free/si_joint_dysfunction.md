How Your Input Relates
You indicated pain in your lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, without difficulty in tasks like 
lifting your knee or climbing stairs. These symptoms are commonly associated with SI joint dysfunction, 
so this guide focuses on helping you understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 
2007].

What Is SI Joint Dysfunction?
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction involves pain from the sacroiliac joints, which connect the lower spine to the 
pelvis, often due to inflammation or abnormal motion [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. It affects approximately 10–
25% of people with low back pain [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Pain in the lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, often one-sided, sometimes 
spreading to the buttock. Pain may worsen with prolonged sitting, standing, or twisting movements 
[Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Changing positions, lying down, or gentle movement may reduce discomfort in some cases 
[Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Other Signs: Typically no significant weakness or numbness, unlike nerve-related conditions 
[Vroomen et al., 1999].

Causes may include injury, pregnancy, arthritis, or repetitive stress. Most cases improve with 
conservative care within 6–12 weeks [Qaseem et al., 2017].

When to Seek Help
Most SI joint pain improves within 6–12 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et al., 
2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et 
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
