Thank you for using PainOptix™, developed by Dr. Carpentier at DrCPainMD, to explore back pain 

How Your Input Relates
You indicated that your pain affec ts your lower back and both legs, is constant or worsens with sitting or 
bending forward, and does not improve with sitting or bending forward. These symptoms are commonly 
associated with a central disc bulge, so this guide focuses on helping you understand this condition to 
discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is a Central Disc Bulge?
A central disc bulge occurs when a spinal disc protrudes backward into the spinal canal, potentially 
pressing on nerves or the spinal cord, often at the L4–S1 levels [Chou et al., 2007]. It affects about 1–
2% of people with back pain [Weber, 1983]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Constant pain in the lower back and both legs, or pain worsened by sitting or bending 
forward. May include numbness or tingling in both legs [Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Lying flat may reduce discomfort for some people, but sitting or bending forward typically 
does not help [Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Other Signs: Mild leg weakness or difficulty with tasks like walking on heels or toes may occur in 
some cases [Vroomen et al., 1999].
Causes include disc degeneration, injury, or repetitive stress. Most cases improve with conservative care 

within 4–6 weeks, though some may require further evaluation [Weber, 1983].

When to Seek Help
Most disc-related pain improves within 4–6 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et 
al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et 
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
