Thank you for using PainOptix™, developed by Dr. Carpentier at DrCPainMD, to explore back pain 

How Your Input Relates
You indicated that your pain extends from your lower back into one leg, going below the knee, and 
possibly difficulty with tasks like walking on heels or toes. These symptoms are commonly associated 
with sciatica, so this guide focuses on helping you understand this condition to discuss with a doctor 
[Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Sciatica?
Sciatica is pain that radiates from the lower back down one leg, often caused by irritation or 
compression of the sciatic nerve, typically from a herniated disc at the L4–S1 levels of the spine [Chou 
et al., 2007]. It affects about 4% of people with back pain [Chou et al., 2007]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Pain, numbness, or tingling in the lower back and one leg, often extending below the 
knee. Pain may worsen with sitting, coughing, or sneezing [Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Relief: Lying down, gentle walking, or changing positions may reduce discomfort in some cases 
[Chou et al., 2007].
- Other Signs: Mild weakness in the foot or difficulty lifting the toes (foot drop) may occur, or 
difficulty with tasks like walking on heels or toes [Vroomen et al., 1999].
Sciatica is often caused by a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or muscle strain. About 90% of cases 
improve within 4–6 weeks without surgery, though some may require medical intervention [Weber, 

1983].

When to Seek Help
Most sciatica improves within 4–6 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et al., 2007; 
Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et 
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
