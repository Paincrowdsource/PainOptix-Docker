How Your Input Relates
You indicated one or more of the following: difficulty controlling bladder or bowels, numbness in {{numbLocation}}
groin or inner thighs, new or worsening leg weakness, or concerns like unexplained weight loss, fever, or
a history of cancer. These symptoms are associated with potentially serious conditions, so this guide
focuses on urgent back pain symptoms to help you discuss them with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007;
Downie et al., 2013].

If you have noticed symptoms like these, medical guidelines suggest you consider talking to a doctor promptly [Chou et al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013].
What Are Urgent Back Pain Symptoms?
Some back pain symptoms, seen in less than 1% of cases, may suggest serious conditions like cauda
equina syndrome, spinal infection, or fracture [Downie et al., 2013]. These include:
- Bladder or Bowel Changes: Trouble urinating, inability to urinate, or loss of control may indicate
cauda equina syndrome, a rare condition (~0.04% of back pain cases) that can cause permanent
nerve damage if untreated [Chou et al., 2007].
- numbness in {{numbLocation}}, inner thighs,
buttocks) may suggest nerve compression [Gardner et al., 2011].
- Leg Weakness: New or worsening difficulty walking, lifting the foot (foot drop), or performing tasks
like heel/toe walking may point to nerve or spinal issues [Downie et al., 2013].
infection (prevalence ~0.01%) or malignancy (post-test probability 7–33% with cancer history)
[Chou et al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013].

These symptoms are rare but critical, as delayed care can lead to serious outcomes like paralysis or loss
of bladder function [Todd, 2005].

When to Seek Help
Medical guidelines highlight that some symptoms need urgent attention [Chou et al., 2007; Downie et
al., 2013]:
often requires evaluation within hours to avoid permanent damage (e.g., paralysis) [Todd, 2005].
for nerve damage [Downie et al., 2013].
malignancy [Chou et al., 2007].
