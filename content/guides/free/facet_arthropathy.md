How Your Input Relates
You indicated that your pain is in your lower back, possibly worsening with bending backward, standing,
or at the end of the day. These symptoms are commonly associated with facet arthropathy, so this guide
focuses on helping you understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Facet Arthropathy?
Facet arthropathy involves irritation or wear in the lumbar facet joints, small joints at the back of the
spine that guide movements like bending and twisting [Adams & Hutton, 1983]. It affects 15–45% of
people with chronic low back pain, especially those over 40 [Kalichman et al., 2008]. Common features
include:
- Symptoms: Low back pain, often on one side, sometimes spreading to the buttock or upper thigh
(rarely below the knee). Pain may worsen with standing, arching backward, or transitioning from
sitting to standing [Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Relief: Sitting with lumbar support, leaning forward, or gentle walking may reduce discomfort [Chou
et al., 2007].
- Other Signs: Morning stiffness or discomfort after prolonged rest, often improving with light
movement [Kalichman et al., 2008].
Facet arthropathy is often caused by aging, repetitive stress (e.g., poor posture), or injury. Most cases
improve within 6–12 weeks with conservative care [Manchikanti et al., 2010].

When to Seek Help
Most back pain improves within 6–12 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et al.,
2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
