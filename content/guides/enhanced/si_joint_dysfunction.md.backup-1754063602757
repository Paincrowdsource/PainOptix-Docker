PainOptix™ SI Joint Dysfunction Education Guide
Exploring Sacroiliac Joint Pain
Prepared for: General Use
Date: July 19, 2025
Learn About Sacroiliac Joint Pain
Thank you for using PainOptix™, developed by Dr. Carpentier at DrCPainMD, to explore back pain 
information. This guide provides general education about sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction, a condition 
causing pain in the lower back or pelvis, based on your responses indicating symptoms like pain in the 
groin or front/side of the thigh without movement difficulty. It aims to:
- Explain SI joint dysfunction symptoms and possible causes using trusted medical guidelines.
- Share general strategies to discuss with a doctor for managing pelvic or back pain.
- Encourage learning from others’ experiences on PainCrowdsource.org.
This guide is for educational purposes only and does not diagnose or treat your condition. Share it with 
a healthcare provider for a full evaluation and personalized advice.
How Your Input Relates
You indicated pain in your lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, without difficulty in tasks like 
lifting your knee or climbing stairs. These symptoms are commonly associated with SI joint dysfunction, 
so this guide focuses on helping you understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 
2007].
What Is SI Joint Dysfunction?
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction involves pain from the sacroiliac joints, which connect the lower spine to the 
pelvis, often due to inflammation or abnormal motion [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. It affects approximately 10–
25% of people with low back pain [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Pain in the lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, often one-sided, sometimes 
spreading to the buttock. Pain may worsen with prolonged sitting, standing, or twisting movements 
[Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Changing positions, lying down, or gentle movement may reduce discomfort in some cases 
[Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Other Signs: Typically no significant weakness or numbness, unlike nerve-related conditions 
[Vroomen et al., 1999].

What Is SI Joint Dysfunction?
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction involves pain from the sacroiliac joints, which connect the lower spine to the 
pelvis, often due to inflammation or abnormal motion [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. It affects approximately 10–
25% of people with low back pain [Cohen & Raja, 2020]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Pain in the lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, often one-sided, sometimes 
spreading to the buttock. Pain may worsen with prolonged sitting, standing, or twisting movements 
[Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Changing positions, lying down, or gentle movement may reduce discomfort in some cases 
[Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Other Signs: Typically no significant weakness or numbness, unlike nerve-related conditions 
[Vroomen et al., 1999].

Causes may include injury, pregnancy, arthritis, or repetitive stress. Most cases improve with 
conservative care within 6–12 weeks [Qaseem et al., 2017].
How Doctors Evaluate SI Joint Dysfunction
Healthcare providers assess SI joint dysfunction through:
- Physical Exam: Performing tests like the FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation) test or 
palpating the SI joint to assess pain or mobility [Chou et al., 2007].
- Medical History: Asking about pain location (e.g., groin, thigh), triggers, or activities like sitting to 
identify patterns [Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Te sts: Imaging (e.g., X-ray, MRI) is rarely needed unless pain persists over 6–8 weeks; diagnostic 
injections may confirm SI joint involvement [Chou et al., 2007].
A doctor’s evaluation is essential to confirm SI joint dysfunction and rule out other causes, like hip 
problems or nerve issues.
General Strategies to Discuss with a Doctor
If you notice symptoms like groin or thigh pain, medical guidelines suggest considering these steps 
[Chou et al., 2007; Qaseem et al., 2017]:
- Ta lktoa   Doct or: Share symptoms like pain in the groin or thigh to get a thorough evaluation and 
tailored advice.
- Stay Active Safely: Discuss gentle activities, like walking, with a doctor to maintain mobility without 
worsening symptoms.
- Explore Comfort Options: Talk to a doctor about heat therapy, pelvic supports, or stretching, which 
may help ease discomfort for some people [Brosseau et al., 2003].
- Track Symptom Details: Note when pain occurs (e.g., with sitting or twisting) to help your doctor 
assess your condition.
When to Seek Help
Most SI joint pain improves within 6–12 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice [Chou et al., 
2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
- Persistent Pain: Pain in the back, groin, or thigh lasting over 6–8 weeks despite rest or self-care.
- Urgent Symptoms: Bladder or bowel changes, groin numbness, or severe leg weakness, which may 
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et 
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
- Other Concerns: Fever, unexplained weight loss, or pain with a history of cancer, requiring urgent 
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
What Happens Next
- Medical Evaluation: A doctor may use physical exams or, rarely, imaging (e.g., X-ray) to confirm SI 
joint dysfunction or other causes [Chou et al., 2007].
- Possible Approaches: Discuss options with a doctor, such as physical therapy, medications (e.g., 
NSAIDs), or, in rare cases, SI joint injections for persistent pain [Qaseem et al., 2017].
