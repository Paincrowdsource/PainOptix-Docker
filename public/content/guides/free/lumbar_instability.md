How Your Input Relates
You indicated pain in your lower back, possibly worsened by getting up from sitting or rolling over in
bed, bending forward or backward, or feeling worse in the morning after resting. These symptoms are
commonly associated with lumbar instability, so this guide focuses on helping you understand this
condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Lumbar Instability?
Lumbar instability refers to excessive or abnormal movement in the lumbar spine, often due to
weakened ligaments, muscles, or degenerated discs [Panjabi, 1992]. It affects about 5–10% of people
with chronic low back pain [Panjabi, 1992]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Lower back pain, often worse when transitioning from sitting to standing, rolling over in
bed, or bending forward or backward. Pain may feel like a “catch” or instability [Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Gentle movement or specific positions (e.g., lying flat) may reduce discomfort in some cases
[Rasmussen-Barr et al., 2009].
- Other Signs: Morning stiffness or discomfort after prolonged rest, sometimes improving with light
activity [Panjabi, 1992].
Causes may include disc degeneration, previous injuries, or muscle weakness. Most cases improve with

conservative care within 6–12 weeks, though some require further evaluation [Qaseem et al., 2017].

When to Seek Help
Most lumbar instability symptoms improve within 6–12 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you
notice [Chou et al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
