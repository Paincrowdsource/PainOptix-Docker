Thank you for using PainOptix™, developed by Dr. Carpentier at DrCPainMD, to explore back pain

How Your Input Relates
You indicated that your pain affects your lower back and both legs, worsens with standing or walking
(especially on flat or downhill surfaces), and may improve with sitting or bending forward. These
symptoms are commonly associated with canal stenosis, so this guide focuses on helping you
understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Canal Stenosis?
Canal stenosis, or spinal stenosis, is a narrowing of the spinal canal that may compress the spinal cord
or nerve roots, often in the lumbar spine [Chou et al., 2007]. It affects about 3% of people with back
pain, more commonly in those over 60 [Chou et al., 2007]. Common features include:
- Symptoms: Pain or numbness in {{numbLocation}}, often worsening with standing
upright or walking (especially downhill) and improving with sitting or bending forward (e.g., leaning
on a counter) [de Graaf et al., 2006].
- Relief: Sitting, leaning forward, or lying down may reduce discomfort [Chou et al., 2007].
- Other Signs: Leg weakness or heaviness during walking (neurogenic claudication) may occur,
sometimes with difficulty in tasks like walking on heels or toes [de Graaf et al., 2006].
Causes include aging, osteoarthritis, or thickened ligaments. Symptoms may improve with conservative

care, though some cases persist or require surgery [Qaseem et al., 2017].

When to Seek Help
Most canal stenosis symptoms improve or stabilize with time, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice
[Chou et al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
