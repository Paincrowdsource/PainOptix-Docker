Learn About Upper Lumbar Radiculopathy

How Your Input Relates
You indicated symptoms such as pain in the groin or front/side of the thigh, or difficulty with tasks like
lifting your knee, straightening your knee fully, standing from a low seat, or walking on heels or toes.
These are commonly associated with upper lumbar radiculopathy, so this guide focuses on helping you
understand this condition to discuss with a doctor [Chou et al., 2007].

What Is Upper Lumbar Radiculopathy?
Upper lumbar radiculopathy is pain or discomfort caused by irritation or compression of nerve roots in
the upper lumbar spine (L1–L3 levels), less common than lower lumbar issues like sciatica [Vroomen et
al., 1999]. It affects approximately 1–2% of radiculopathy cases [Chou et al., 2007]. Common features
include:
- Symptoms: Pain in the lower back, groin, or front/side of the thigh, often with numbness or tingling.
May include weakness or difficulty with movements like lifting the knee or straightening the leg
[Chou et al., 2007].
- Relief: Resting, changing positions, or avoiding aggravating movements may reduce discomfort
[Cohen & Raja, 2020].
- Other Signs: Difficulty with tasks like climbing stairs, standing from a low seat, or walking on
heels/toes due to nerve-related weakness [Vroomen et al., 1999].
Causes may include herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or osteoarthritis in the upper lumbar spine. Most
cases improve with conservative care within 4–6 weeks, though some require further evaluation [Weber,
1983].

When to Seek Help
Most radiculopathy symptoms improve within 4–6 weeks, but contact a doctor promptly if you notice
[Chou et al., 2007; Downie et al., 2013]:
need immediate care (e.g., within hours for cauda equina syndrome, prevalence ~0.04%) [Chou et
al., 2007; Todd, 2005].
evaluation to rule out infection or malignancy [Downie et al., 2013].
